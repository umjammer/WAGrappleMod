This is an attempted port to 1.18.2. ([original](https://github.com/Azim/WAGrappleMod)) \
It works somehow! \
Take over and complete it because I'm a programmer w/o 3d knowledge.

## Requires

 * fabric
 * fabric-api.
 * MC version 1.18.2

## TODO

 * rope recalculating it's position when blocks destroyed
 * make it work better in multiplayer
 * bug fixes
 * dungeon block (this will be a better default ungrapplable block)
